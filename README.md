# Ng17Structure

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.2.

## Purpose

This project has been released as a base for an Angular 17 project from the scratch. Feel free to use it in your projects, no license neither atributions are required.

Some structure has been added to the project in order to make it modular with three modules:

* ### Public -> pages in the app with public access
* ### Intranet -> Intranet section in your project
* ### Admin -> Platform admin area

The initial routes of the app have also been structured, adding lazy loading to the routing of the main modules

Enjoy and if you want to star it, itÂ´ll be really welcome!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
